# Dementia Detection App

The **Dementia Detection App** is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to help detect early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. This app records a person's speech, preprocesses the audio recording, extracts **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)**, and uses a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model to predict whether the individual shows early signs of dementia.
